//! Stack-based routing utilities for shard components.
//!
//! Each `#[shard]` function generates a `*Destination` type that implements
//! [`RouterDestination`]. These destinations are managed in a LIFO stack.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! * Maintain an ordered stack (`route_stack`) of active destinations
//! * Expose [`push`] / [`pop`] helpers that also manage shard state lifetimes
//! * Remove per‑shard state from the registry when a destination whose lifecycle is
//!   `ShardStateLifeCycle::Shard` is popped
//! * Keep routing logic minimal; rendering happens when the top destination's
//!   `exec_component()` is invoked every frame by `router_root`
//!
//! # Typical Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Navigate forward
//! tessera_ui::router::push(HomeScreenDestination { /* fields */ });
//! // Navigate back
//! tessera_ui::router::pop();
//! ```
//!
//! # Related
//!
//! * `#[shard]` macro – generates the `*Destination` structs + optional state injection
//! * `tessera_ui::router::router_root` – executes the current top destination each frame
