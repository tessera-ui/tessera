# tessera-mobile

Fork of [`cargo-mobile2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/cargo-mobile2) maintained inside the Tessera monorepo. We focus on Tessera’s needs; compatibility with non-Tessera workflows is not guaranteed.

## Fork status

- Upstream origin: `tauri-apps/cargo-mobile2` (Apache-2.0 OR MIT)
- Scope: primary focus on Android; iOS may be kept or trimmed based on Tessera needs.
- CLI binaries (`cargo-*`) may remain upstream-style, but this fork is primarily consumed as a library by `cargo-tessera`.
