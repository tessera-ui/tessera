# Instructions

This document defines how You should assist in the Tessera project to ensure code and documentation are consistent with project architecture, style, and best practices.

---

## Language Policy

- **All code, comments, and documentation comments must be written in English**, including rustdoc, commit messages, and PR descriptions. Use other languages only when absolutely necessary for functional clarification.
- **This document itself is a development guideline and should be maintained in English only. No i18n is required.**

## üß† Project Overview & Structure

- **Project Type**: Rust UI Framework
- **Core Crates**:
  - **tessera-ui**: Framework core (component tree, rendering, runtime, basic types Dp/Px, event handling, etc.)
  - **tessera-ui-basic-components**: Basic UI components (row, column, text, button, surface, etc.) and their rendering pipelines
  - **tessera-ui-macros**: The `#[tessera]` procedural macro for simplified component definition
  - **example**: Example project demonstrating framework usage

**Module Path Convention**: All modules must use the `src/module_name.rs` pattern. Do not use `src/module_name/mod.rs`.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Development Model

### Component Model & #[tessera] Macro

- Components are stateless Rust functions annotated with `#[tessera]`. All state must be passed via parameters (e.g., `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or atomic types).
- Inside the component function:
  - `measure`: Custom layout and measurement logic (optional)
  - `input_handler`: Event and interaction handling (optional)
  - All child component closures must be executed to build the complete component tree

**Automatic Injection**: `measure` and `input_handler` are injected by the macro and do not require manual import.

### Component Tree & Node Metadata

- The component tree is managed via structures like `ComponentNode` and `ComponentNodeMetaData`, supporting parallel measurement and rendering.

---

## üìè Layout & Measurement System

- Use `Constraint` and `DimensionValue` to describe size constraints.
- `measure_nodes` supports parallel measurement of multiple child nodes.
- `place_node` is used to position child nodes.
- Default layout: If `measure` is not called, all child nodes are stacked at (0,0), and the container size is the minimal bounding rectangle.

---

## üé® Rendering & Pipeline System

- Rendering uses a pluggable architecture:
  - **DrawCommand**: Trait describing renderable objects
  - **DrawablePipeline**/**ComputablePipeline**: GPU rendering/compute logic
  - **PipelineRegistry**: Registers all pipelines at startup
- Components set draw/compute commands via `ComponentNodeMetaData`
- The basic components crate provides common pipelines, which must be registered at entry (e.g., `register_pipelines`)

### Barrier System & Performance Optimization

- **BarrierRequirement**: An enum used by both `DrawCommand` and `ComputeCommand` to declare if it needs to sample from the previously rendered scene. This is crucial for effects like blur or glass morphism.
- `Global`: Samples the entire screen. This is expensive as it requires a full-screen texture copy.
- `PaddedLocal { top: Px, right: Px, bottom: Px, left: Px }`: Defines a region relative to the component's bounding box plus specified padding on each side. This is used to determine the **scissor rectangle** for the draw pass, limiting GPU work to the relevant area.
- `Absolute(PxRect)`: Samples a specific, absolute region of the screen.
- **Performance Optimization**: When a command requires a barrier, the renderer performs a **full-screen texture copy** to make the background available for sampling. The key optimization is **batching**: subsequent commands that also require a barrier and have non-overlapping draw regions are processed in the same render pass, avoiding additional expensive texture copies. A scissor rectangle is applied to limit the actual drawing area for each command.

## üéØ Event & State Management

- Components are stateless; all state is passed via parameters (prefer `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or atomic types).
- Event handling is done via the `input_handler` closure, which receives `InputHandlerInput` containing:
  - `node_id`, `computed_data`, `cursor_position`
  - `cursor_events`, `keyboard_events`, `ime_events`
- Mouse, keyboard, and IME events are processed via event queues and must be consumed promptly.
- Event handlers should be lightweight to avoid blocking the main loop.

---

## üìê Unit System

- **Dp (Density-independent Pixel)**: Used for public APIs, component sizes, margins, paddings, etc.; automatically adapts to DPI
- **Px (Physical Pixel)**: Used internally for rendering and measurement, for precise pixel-level operations
- The framework automatically converts between Dp and Px based on the screen scale factor. Prefer Dp for development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution & Style Guidelines

- **Code Style**:
  - Enforce `rustfmt edition 2024` default rules
  - `use` imports must be grouped in four sections (standard library, third-party crates, crate root, submodules), separated by one blank line, sorted alphabetically within each group, and merged by root path
  - All code, comments, and documentation comments must be in English (except for rare functional clarifications)
- **Commit Guidelines**:
  - Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification
  - Ensure all tests pass, documentation is updated, and formatting checks are clean before committing
- **Documentation**:
  - Main documentation must be in English. Other language versions, if any, should be placed in the docs/ directory and kept in sync with the English version.
  - Documentation format should pass markdown lint if possible

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Special Notes

- **example crate**: `example/Cargo.toml` is intentionally configured with both `[lib]` and `[[bin]]` pointing to `src/lib.rs` for compatibility with both testing and running. The resulting compiler warning is expected‚Äîdo not remove the `[[bin]]` section.

---

## FAQ

- **Module Path**: Always use `src/module_name.rs`, never `mod.rs`
- **Components must be stateless**; all state is passed via parameters
- **Events must be consumed promptly** to avoid missing or duplicate handling

If there are any changes to the architecture or conventions, this file and the main documentation must be updated accordingly to ensure consistency between documentation and code.
