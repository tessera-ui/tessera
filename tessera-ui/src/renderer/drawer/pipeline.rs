//! Graphics rendering pipeline system for Tessera UI framework.
//!
//! This module provides the core infrastructure for pluggable graphics rendering pipelines
//! in Tessera. The design philosophy emphasizes flexibility and extensibility, allowing
//! developers to create custom rendering effects without being constrained by built-in
//! drawing primitives.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The pipeline system uses a trait-based approach with type erasure to support dynamic
//! dispatch of rendering commands. Each pipeline is responsible for rendering a specific
//! type of draw command, such as shapes, text, images, or custom visual effects.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - [`DrawablePipeline<T>`]: The main trait for implementing custom rendering pipelines
//! - [`PipelineRegistry`]: Manages and dispatches commands to registered pipelines
//! - [`ErasedDrawablePipeline`]: Internal trait for type erasure and dynamic dispatch
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Unlike traditional UI frameworks that provide built-in "brush" or drawing primitives,
//! Tessera treats shaders as first-class citizens. This approach offers several advantages:
//!
//! - **Modern GPU Utilization**: Leverages WGPU and WGSL for efficient, cross-platform rendering
//! - **Advanced Visual Effects**: Enables complex effects like neumorphic design, lighting,
//!   shadows, reflections, and bloom that are difficult to achieve with traditional approaches
//! - **Flexibility**: Custom shaders allow for unlimited creative possibilities
//! - **Performance**: Direct GPU programming eliminates abstraction overhead
//!
//! # Pipeline Lifecycle
//!
//! Each pipeline follows a three-phase lifecycle during rendering:
//!
//! 1. **Begin Pass**: Setup phase for initializing pipeline-specific resources
//! 2. **Draw**: Main rendering phase where commands are processed
//! 3. **End Pass**: Cleanup phase for finalizing rendering operations
//!
//! # Implementation Guide
//!
//! ## Creating a Custom Pipeline
//!
//! To create a custom rendering pipeline:
//!
//! 1. Define your draw command struct implementing [`DrawCommand`]
//! 2. Create a pipeline struct implementing [`DrawablePipeline<YourCommand>`]
//! 3. Register the pipeline with [`PipelineRegistry::register`]
//!
//! ## Example: Simple Rectangle Pipeline
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use tessera_ui::{DrawCommand, DrawablePipeline, PxPosition, PxSize};
//! use wgpu;
//!
//! // 1. Define the draw command
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct RectangleCommand {
//!     color: [f32; 4],
//!     corner_radius: f32,
//! }
//!
//! impl DrawCommand for RectangleCommand {
//!     // Most commands don't need barriers
//!     fn barrier(&self) -> Option<tessera_ui::BarrierRequirement> {
//!         None
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // 2. Implement the pipeline
//! struct RectanglePipeline {
//!     render_pipeline: wgpu::RenderPipeline,
//!     uniform_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
//!     bind_group: wgpu::BindGroup,
//! }
//!
//! impl RectanglePipeline {
//!     fn new(device: &wgpu::Device, config: &wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration, sample_count: u32) -> Self {
//!         // Create shader, pipeline, buffers, etc.
//!         // ... implementation details ...
//!         # unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl DrawablePipeline<RectangleCommand> for RectanglePipeline {
//!     fn draw(
//!         &mut self,
//!         gpu: &wgpu::Device,
//!         gpu_queue: &wgpu::Queue,
//!         config: &wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration,
//!         render_pass: &mut wgpu::RenderPass<'_>,
//!         command: &RectangleCommand,
//!         size: PxSize,
//!         start_pos: PxPosition,
//!         scene_texture_view: &wgpu::TextureView,
//!     ) {
//!         // Update uniforms with command data
//!         // Set pipeline and draw
//!         render_pass.set_pipeline(&self.render_pipeline);
//!         render_pass.set_bind_group(0, &self.bind_group, &[]);
//!         render_pass.draw(0..6, 0..1); // Draw quad
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // 3. Register the pipeline
//! let mut registry = PipelineRegistry::new();
//! let rectangle_pipeline = RectanglePipeline::new(&device, &config, sample_count);
//! registry.register(rectangle_pipeline);
//! ```
//!
//! # Integration with Basic Components
//!
//! The `tessera_basic_components` crate demonstrates real-world pipeline implementations:
//!
//! - **ShapePipeline**: Renders rounded rectangles, circles, and complex shapes with shadows and ripple effects
//! - **TextPipeline**: Handles text rendering with font management and glyph caching
//! - **ImagePipeline**: Displays images with various scaling and filtering options
//! - **FluidGlassPipeline**: Creates advanced glass effects with distortion and transparency
//!
//! These pipelines are registered in `tessera_ui_basic_components::pipelines::register_pipelines()`.
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//!
//! - **Batch Similar Commands**: Group similar draw commands to minimize pipeline switches
//! - **Resource Management**: Reuse buffers and textures when possible
//! - **Shader Optimization**: Write efficient shaders optimized for your target platforms
//! - **State Changes**: Minimize render state changes within the draw method
//!
//! # Advanced Features
//!
//! ## Barrier Requirements
//!
//! Some rendering effects need to sample from previously rendered content (e.g., blur effects).
//! Implement [`DrawCommand::barrier()`] to return [`BarrierRequirement::SampleBackground`]
//! for such commands.
//!
//! ## Multi-Pass Rendering
//!
//! Use `begin_pass()` and `end_pass()` for pipelines that require multiple rendering passes
//! or complex setup/teardown operations.
//!
//! ## Scene Texture Access
//!
//! The `scene_texture_view` parameter provides access to the current scene texture,
//! enabling effects that sample from the background or perform post-processing.

/// Core trait for implementing custom graphics rendering pipelines.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for rendering pipelines that process specific types
/// of draw commands. Each pipeline is responsible for setting up GPU resources,
/// managing render state, and executing the actual drawing operations.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The specific [`DrawCommand`] type this pipeline can handle
///
/// # Lifecycle Methods
///
/// The pipeline system provides five lifecycle hooks, executed in the following order:
///
/// 1. [`begin_frame()`](Self::begin_frame): Called once at the start of a new frame, before any render passes.
/// 2. [`begin_pass()`](Self::begin_pass): Called at the start of each render pass that involves this pipeline.
/// 3. [`draw()`](Self::draw): Called for each command of type `T` within a render pass.
/// 4. [`end_pass()`](Self::end_pass): Called at the end of each render pass that involved this pipeline.
/// 5. [`end_frame()`](Self::end_frame): Called once at the end of the frame, after all render passes are complete.
///
/// Typically, `begin_pass`, `draw`, and `end_pass` are used for the core rendering logic within a pass,
/// while `begin_frame` and `end_frame` are used for setup and teardown that spans the entire frame.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// - Only the [`draw()`](Self::draw) method is required; others have default empty implementations.
/// - Pipelines should be stateless between frames when possible
/// - Resource management should prefer reuse over recreation
/// - Consider batching multiple commands for better performance
///
/// # Example
///
/// See the module-level documentation for a complete implementation example.
#[allow(unused_variables)]

    /// It's ideal for per-frame setup that is not tied to a specific `wgpu::RenderPass`.
    ///
    /// Since this method is called outside a render pass, it cannot be used for drawing
    /// commands. However, it can be used for operations like:
    ///
    /// - Updating frame-global uniform buffers (e.g., with time or resolution data)
    ///   using [`wgpu::Queue::write_buffer`].
    /// - Preparing or resizing buffers that will be used throughout the frame.
    /// - Performing CPU-side calculations needed for the frame.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `gpu` - The WGPU device, for resource creation.
    /// * `gpu_queue` - The WGPU queue, for submitting buffer writes.

    /// # Implementation Guidelines
    ///
    /// - Iterate over the `commands` slice to process each command.
    /// - Update buffers (e.g., instance buffers, storage buffers) with data from the command batch.

    /// - Bind necessary resources (textures, buffers, bind groups).
    /// - Issue one or more draw calls (e.g., an instanced draw call) to render the entire batch.

/// Registry for managing and dispatching drawable pipelines.

/// # Architecture
///
/// The registry uses type erasure to store pipelines of different types in a single
